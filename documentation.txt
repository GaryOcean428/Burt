DEV NOTES:

1. Completed Tasks:
   [Previous completed tasks remain unchanged]

   i. AdvancedRouter Fix:
      - Updated the _select_model_config method in app/advanced_router.py to use the .get() method when accessing performance_factor values.
      - This change prevents KeyError exceptions when a tier hasn't been used yet and doesn't have an entry in the performance_factor dictionary.
      - The relevant part of the method now looks like this:
        ```python
        elif (
            complexity < self.threshold
            and context_length < 4000
            and performance_factor.get("mid", 1.0) <= 1.2
        ):
            return self._get_mid_tier_config(task_type)
        ```
      - Similar changes were applied to other tier checks in the method.

2. Current State:
   - The KeyError issue in the AdvancedRouter should now be resolved.
   - The application should be able to process queries without encountering the previous error.

3. Next Steps:
   a. Test the application:
      - Run the application using the command: `poetry run python -m app.main --verbose`
      - Test various queries, especially those that might trigger different model tiers.
      - Verify that no KeyError exceptions occur during query processing.

   b. Code Quality Improvements:
      - Run Flake8 on the entire project: `poetry run flake8`
      - Address any remaining linting issues, with special attention to:
        1. app/main.py
        2. app/python/helpers/perplexity_search.py
        3. app/python/helpers/rag_system.py
        4. app/advanced_router.py

   c. Type Hinting and Pylance Errors:
      - Review and address Pylance errors, particularly in:
        1. rag_system.py
        2. perplexity_search.py
      - Improve type hinting to resolve "reportArgumentType" and "reportAttributeAccessIssue" errors.

   d. Performance Optimization:
      - Profile Pinecone and MongoDB operations.
      - Identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks.

   e. Documentation Update:
      - Update README.md to reflect:
        1. The new Poetry setup for dependency management.
        2. Updated Pinecone initialization process.
        3. NLTK resource requirements and automatic download process.
        4. Recent changes to the AdvancedRouter and error handling improvements.

4. Considerations:
   - Continue to ensure all dictionary accesses in the router logic are using safe methods to prevent KeyError exceptions.
   - Consider adding more detailed logging statements to track the values of key variables (like performance_factor) for easier debugging.
   - Maintain compatibility with the Poetry environment throughout all changes.
   - Regularly test to prevent regressions in functionality.

5. Future Enhancements:
   - Consider implementing a more robust error handling system throughout the application.
   - Evaluate the possibility of adding unit tests for the AdvancedRouter and other critical components.
   - Explore options for improving the performance metrics collection and analysis for model selection.

6. Recent Recommendations:
   a. Testing:
      - Conduct thorough testing of the AdvancedRouter, especially the _select_model_config method, to ensure the KeyError fix works as expected.
      - Create a set of test queries that cover different complexity levels, context lengths, and task types to verify the model selection logic.

   b. Code Quality:
      - In addition to addressing linting issues, consider using a tool like Black for consistent code formatting across the project.
      - Implement more comprehensive error handling in the AdvancedRouter class, particularly in the process method.

   c. Type Hinting:
      - Add type hints to all methods in the AdvancedRouter class, including return types.
      - Use mypy in addition to Pylance for static type checking.

   d. Performance:
      - Implement caching for frequently accessed data in the AdvancedRouter, such as model configurations.
      - Consider using asyncio more extensively throughout the application for improved concurrency.

   e. Documentation:
      - Create a separate CHANGELOG.md file to track all significant changes to the project.
      - Add inline documentation to complex methods in the AdvancedRouter class, explaining the logic behind model selection and parameter adjustments.

   f. Refactoring:
      - Consider breaking down the AdvancedRouter class into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., ModelSelector, PerformanceTracker) to improve maintainability.
      - Implement a strategy pattern for different routing strategies, allowing for easier addition of new routing algorithms in the future.

   g. Monitoring and Logging:
      - Implement more detailed logging throughout the AdvancedRouter class, including input parameters and decision points in the routing process.
      - Consider integrating a monitoring solution to track performance metrics and errors in real-time.

   h. Security:
      - Review the handling of sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in the configuration and ensure they are not logged or exposed.
      - Implement input validation for all user-provided data to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

   i. Scalability:
      - Evaluate the current rate limiting implementation and consider more advanced strategies that can adapt to varying load conditions.
      - Explore options for distributed processing of queries if the application needs to handle higher loads in the future.

Remember to prioritize these recommendations based on the project's current needs and resources. Implement changes incrementally and continue to test thoroughly after each significant modification.

Remember: All modifications should consider the project holistically. Avoid changes that might reduce existing or intended capabilities of the project.

7. Recent Updates:
   a. AdvancedRouter Fix:
      - Added a PerformanceTracker class to handle performance tracking for different model tiers.
      - Updated the AdvancedRouter class to initialize a performance_tracker attribute.
      - This fix addresses the AttributeError that was occurring when processing queries.

   b. Frontend Issue:
      - Identified an issue where the thread history in the left sidebar displays past prompts instead of threads.
      - TODO: Update the frontend code to properly display conversation threads.

8. Next Steps:
   a. Implement the update_performance method in the PerformanceTracker class to adjust performance factors based on processing times.
   b. Update the frontend code to correctly display conversation threads in the left sidebar.
   c. Conduct thorough testing of the AdvancedRouter with various query types to ensure stability.
   d. Review and update error handling in the main query processing flow to provide more informative error messages to users.
